pancancer-bag
=============

This contains Bash scripts that deploy a [SeqWare](https://github.com/SeqWare) cluster with pan-cancer customizations for [Bindle](https://github.com/CloudBindle/Bindle)

Currently, this playbook has a dependency on [seqware-bag](https://github.com/SeqWare/seqware-bag) which needs to be checked out in a directory with the same parent.
